# Coding Practice

## What am I doing? 
Starting today, July 26, 2020, I will begin documenting my self-studying journey towards becoming proficient in data structures and algorithms.
## Why am i doing this?
In order to keep myself organized and accountable. 
## How am I doing this?
I will be uplaoding my answers to questions I found in coding challenge websites. I choose to use **Python** beacause it has simpler syntax and useful built-in functions.
